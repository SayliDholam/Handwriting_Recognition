# Handwriting Recognition Application
The primary objective of this project is to allow the processing of data which 
comes from sources which are not in readily available state for analytical 
functions to work upon them.  
Here the concerned domain is the handwritten text base images from which text 
needs to be recognized, displayed and stored. </br>
This is where the application of OCR features, image processing, image storing, 
and alphabetical recognition become relevant.

</br>

## Technologies Used :
- customertkinter : Python GUI library<br/><br/>
 customtkinter is an extension of the standard Tkinter library for Python, designed to provide a more modern and customizable interface. It adds new features and widgets that are not available in the standard Tkinter library, making it easier to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.
<br/><br/> Features of customtkinter : <br/>
Modern Look: Offers a more modern and sleek look for the widgets compared to the traditional Tkinter.<br/>
Customization: Provides more options for customizing the appearance of widgets, including colors, shapes, and styles.
<br/><br/> You can install customtkinter using pip : <br/>
``` pip install customtkinter ```
<br/><br/>

- PyTesseract : OCR <br/>


- MongoDB : Database  <br/>
